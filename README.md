After creating a PogoPlug Linux server using ArchLinux ARM and completing some Arduino Uno projects, I combined the two exciting projects creating a monitor for my home and aquarium. The PogoPlug Linux server, Arduino, code and sensors can be used for any home automation project. Using the Arduino Uno and a waterproof temperature sensor, it would send the data to the PogoPlug and harness the advanced Linux operating system to log, analyze, alert and report on the data received from the Arduino Uno. I chose the PogoPlug Linux server over the Arduino Ethernet Shield and Data Logging Shield for both cost and functionality.

The current version includes temperature monitoring of the fishtank and other home automation features. The application can send reports and alerts via email and text. I incorporated the Arduino Uno into the case of the PogoPlug so that I had one compact server that runs on only 4 watts of power. This project requires basic knowledge of microcontrollers and good working knowledge of Linux and programming.
